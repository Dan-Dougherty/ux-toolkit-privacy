# UX Toolkit Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: [3/24/25]*

## Overview
UX Toolkit is a Chrome extension designed to help web designers and developers analyze and improve website accessibility and design consistency. This privacy policy explains how our extension handles data.

## Data Collection
UX Toolkit does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data. All analysis of webpage colors, contrast, and accessibility is performed locally in your browser and is never sent to external servers.

## Local Usage Only
When you use the Color Palette Tool, Contrast Checker, or Accessibility Checker, the extension only accesses the current webpage to analyze design elements and accessibility issues. This analysis exists only in your browser's memory and is cleared when you close the extension or navigate away from the page.

## Permissions
- **Active Tab**: Required to analyze the currently viewed webpage
- **Scripting**: Required to examine page elements and styles
- **Clipboard Write**: Used only when you explicitly click to copy color codes
- **Side Panel**: Used to display the toolkit interface
- **Host Permissions**: Required to analyze websites you visit, but only when you actively use the extension

## Third-Party Access
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any information to third parties.

## Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
